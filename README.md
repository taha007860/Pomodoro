# üçÖ Pomodoro Clock with React

Welcome to the Pomodoro Clock GitHub repository! In this project, we build a Pomodoro clock/timer using the JavaScript framework React with Hooks especially the Context API and the useContext Hook. The application features smooth animations provided by the React Countdown Circle Timer.

## Overview

- **Introduction**: A quick overview of the Pomodoro clock application.
- **Cleanup**: Removal of default files and code to start with a clean slate.
- **Setting Component**: Development of the component responsible for setting the timer.
- **Timer Component**: Integration of the `react-countdown-circle-timer` package for animated countdown circles.
- **Context**: Creation of a state management component using the Context Hook.
- **Using Context**: Distributing information to other components using the context.
- **Debugging Package**: Fixing the NaN error and addressing issues with circle animation.
- **Running Function onload**: Utilizing the `useEffect` hook to run functions once the React component has mounted.
- **Outro**: A final overview of the application.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
